The kitchen sink of Python utility libraries for doing "stuff" in a functional way. Based on the `Lo-Dash <http://lodash.com/>`_  Javascript library.

Note
====

Looking for a library that is more memory efficient and better suited for large datasets? Check out `fnc <https://github.com/dgilland/fnc>`_! It's built around generators and iteration and has iteratee-first function signatures.
