  http://localhost:5002/auth

### Note About VASCO Integration
The logs show that VASCO library loading has the expected 32-bit compatibility issue:
```
WARNING: Could not load VASCO library: OSError('/opt/vasco/libvacman.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32')
```

This is expected - the VASCO library works through our 32-bit bridge system as demonstrated in the OTP verification tests.
